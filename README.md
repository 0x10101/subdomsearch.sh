# Subdomain Searcher
This script utilizes Google to perform searches for a given domain, excluding all discovered subdomains either until all of the subdomains have been enumerated or until the query argument cap is hit (32)â€”whichever happens first.

If you do too many queries in too short of a time, Google **will** lock out your IP for a few hours.

The code could be prettier, but whatever.

I really don't give a shit about disclaimers.
